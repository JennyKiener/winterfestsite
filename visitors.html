            <p>
                In Adobe, everyone is needed. Also someone that has a master degree in English. That is one of the
                good things about Adobe, it gives all kind of people the possibility to work with them.
                Adobes motto is: work hard play hard, what means that you are very passionate and hard working but
                after you worked hard, you can enjoy little activities like ping pong or just going to the small
                cafeteria on your level. That scheme is directed towards the google campus which has the same
                motto.
                And our guide also told us that you make a pretty good living working at Adobe as a programmer.

            </p>

            <h2>Nate Zobrist</h2>
            <p>

                He told us to be passionate about what we do. Because you can be a programmer and have a good income
                but when you don’t have fun and don’t like it, then it will lead to stress and depression. So when he
                interviews people, he asks them about their hobbies and what they do in their free time. And when you
                have little side projects where you work on in your free time.
                Another very big thing he told and showed us is how many coding languages there are. There are too many
                to learn all of them but when you know some of the basics then it isn’t that difficult to learn others
                anymore.
                At the end he also told us that programmers are always requested in our job life so we won’t have to
                worry about a good income and getting a job easily.

        <div class="Hector">
            <h2>Hector Piña</h2>
            <p>“Becoming a programmer is becoming a lifetime student”, that is a sentence that he got from his mentor
                in
                his 11 week coding camp.
                He is very passionate in what he is doing and said that there is a super bowl moment in every solved
                problem.
                Hector is someone that knows, how much programming can make you feeling down. But he just set the rule
                that
                he won’t work at weekends and thus takes a lot of vacations.
                That doesn’t mean that he does no programming in his vacation. He told us that he once was vacuuming
                when
                the solution to a problem of his coding came to his mind and he just ran to his laptop and solved it.
                So he
                didn’t actually think about the problem but his brain solved it without his consciousness.
                Another thing he mentioned was to use google as often as we can because we don’t want to bug our
                teammate
                when there is a fast solution on google.
                Well, in the end he told us to take our time to play, so to take some time off the screen and do
                something
                we enjoy.

            <p>
                Mr. Olsen, the previous german teacher of Maeser, came in and told us about his tips in programming.
                One of them was to draw out ideas out and AFTER that we should start programming our website.
                Then we should make it as non confusing as possible so that we have a good overview over our own code
                (sometimes it can get super confusing and that leads to a mistake in the code).

        <div class="Ensign">
            <h2>Mr. Ensign</h2>
            <p>
                So when Mr. Ensign came in, he told and explained to us how to make our website with a very good
                design.
                The main essence is to only use 2-3 colors -”keep it as simple as possible”.
                And when you break that rule, do it with a good reason.

        <br>
        <div class="Heaton">
            <h2>Mr. Heaton</h2>
            <p>
                Ryan Heaton works at the Family Search and is there to teach computers how to read old/ancient
                documents. That means he has to teach it how to read all those old fonts which aren’t easy to learn.
                But still, nothing is impossible as long as we reach for our dreams.
                For real job stability you need to become the best programmer that is wanted by many companies so that
                if you lose your job, you still would get one within one week.
                Another very important point in programming is your creativity and the “thinking outside of the box.”
                An advantage of the digital documents of 100 years ago is that they don’t take in as much space as the
                normal paper ones. Furthermore there is access from all over the world.
                There is no limit to what Technology can do, there is a limit to our imagination.
                Another job except programming that is very wanted is Cypersecurity specialists. There are a lot of
                dangers in the world but the one of the internet is even bigger and more dangerous.
