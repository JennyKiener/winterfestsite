    <ul>
        <li>We have fun, but often encounter many problems as we are coding. Whenever we solve these problems, we get a "superbowl feeling" as if we have just scored the winning touchdown at a game.</li>
        <li>Almost all of us started on a level 1 or 2 (we have the levels 1-10). But we progressed and learned not just to do it because we have to but becasue we love it. </li>
        <li>Why Computer Programming? Good quesetion! Computers and Programming is something one can't avoid in the business world today.
            <br>
        It doesn't only get us prepared for our future but also the life we want to live. 
        </li>
        <li>Work hard, play hard! - That is our motto, which means that we work hard on programming but afterwards we do something fun that is for instance
            <br>
            playing ultimate frisbee or just watching something for 20 minutes.</li>
    </ul>
