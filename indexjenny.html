            <li>We have fun, but often encounter many problems as we are coding. Whenever we solve these problems, we
                get a "superbowl feeling" as if we have just scored the winning touchdown at a game.</li>
            <li>Almost all of us started on a level 1 or 2 (we have the levels 1-10). But we progressed and learned not
                just to do it because we have to but becasue we love it. </li>
            <li>Why Computer Programming? Good quesetion! Computers and Programming is something one can't avoid in the
                business world today.
                <br>
                It doesn't only get us prepared for our future but also the life we want to live.
            </li>
            <li>Work hard, play hard! - That is our motto, which means that we work hard on programming but afterwards
                we do something fun that is for instance
                <br>
                playing ultimate frisbee or just watching something for 20 minutes.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="Adobe">
            <p>
                In Adobe, everyone is needed. Also someone that has a master degree in English. That is one of the
                good things about Adobe, it gives all kind of people the possibility to work with them.
                Adobes motto is: work hard play hard, what means that you are very passionate and hard working but
                after you worked hard, you can enjoy little activities like ping pong or just going to the small
                cafeteria on your level. That scheme is directed towards the google campus which has the same
                motto.
                And our guide also told us that you make a pretty good living working at Adobe as a programmer.

            <h2>Nate Zobrist</h2>
            <p>

                He told us to be passionate about what we do. Because you can be a programmer and have a good income
                but when you don’t have fun and don’t like it, then it will lead to stress and depression. So when he
                interviews people, he asks them about their hobbies and what they do in their free time. And when you
                have little side projects where you work on in your free time.
                Another very big thing he told and showed us is how many coding languages there are. There are too many
                to learn all of them but when you know some of the basics then it isn’t that difficult to learn others
                anymore.
                At the end he also told us that programmers are always requested in our job life so we won’t have to
                worry about a good income and getting a job easily.

    <div class="Hector">
        <h2>Hector Piña</h2>
        <p>“Becoming a programmer is becoming a lifetime student”, that is a sentence that he got from his mentor in
            his 11 week coding camp.
            He is very passionate in what he is doing and said that there is a super bowl moment in every solved
            problem.
            Hector is someone that knows, how much programming can make you feeling down. But he just set the rule that
            he won’t work at weekends and thus takes a lot of vacations.
            That doesn’t mean that he does no programming in his vacation. He told us that he once was vacuuming when
            the solution to a problem of his coding came to his mind and he just ran to his laptop and solved it. So he
            didn’t actually think about the problem but his brain solved it without his consciousness.
            Another thing he mentioned was to use google as often as we can because we don’t want to bug our teammate
            when there is a fast solution on google.
            Well, in the end he told us to take our time to play, so to take some time off the screen and do something
            we enjoy.
