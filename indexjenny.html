        <ul>
            <li>We have fun, but often encounter many problems as we are coding. Whenever we solve these problems, we
                get a "superbowl feeling" as if we have just scored the winning touchdown at a game.</li>
            <li>Almost all of us started on a level 1 or 2 (we have the levels 1-10). But we progressed and learned not
                just to do it because we have to but becasue we love it. </li>
            <li>Why Computer Programming? Good quesetion! Computers and Programming is something one can't avoid in the
                business world today.
                <br>
                It doesn't only get us prepared for our future but also the life we want to live.
            </li>
            <li>Work hard, play hard! - That is our motto, which means that we work hard on programming but afterwards
                we do something fun that is for instance
                <br>
                playing ultimate frisbee or just watching something for 20 minutes.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="Hector">
        <p>“Becoming a programmer is becoming a lifetime student”, that is a sentence that he got from his mentor in
            his 11 week coding camp.
            He is very passionate in what he is doing and said that there is a super bowl moment in every solved
            problem.
            Hector is someone that knows, how much programming can make you feeling down. But he just set the rule that
            he won’t work at weekends and thus takes a lot of vacations.
            That doesn’t mean that he does no programming in his vacation. He told us that he once was vacuuming when
            the solution to a problem of his coding came to his mind and he just ran to his laptop and solved it. So he
            didn’t actually think about the problem but his brain solved it without his consciousness.
            Another thing he mentioned was to use google as often as we can because we don’t want to bug our teammate
            when there is a fast solution on google.
            Well, in the end he told us to take our time to play, so to take some time off the screen and do something
            we enjoy.
